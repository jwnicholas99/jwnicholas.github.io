<h4 align="center">Built with Jekyll ðŸ§ª</h4>


Hi! This is the version 2.0 of my personal website.

## Key Features
I use Jekyll as a static site generator so that I can easily update my website. Plus, Jekyll is blog-aware and hence is conducive for writing blog posts.

This is a major upgrade from my previous [personal website](https://github.com/jwnicholas99/2020.portfolio) which was only a single-page application.

## Usage

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
``` 
This installs all the necessary Ruby packages and serves the website at http://localhost:4000.

If you would like to use my website as a template, kindly do credit me somewhere on your site or Github repository.
