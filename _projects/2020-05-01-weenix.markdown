# Overview

In Spring 2019, I developed the majority of a operating system kernel known as "Weenix" as part of the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1670/">CSCI1670: Operating Systems</a> course (and its optional half-credit lab <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs167/content/weenix-doc.pdf">CSCI1690: Operating Systems Laboratory</a>) at Brown University.
