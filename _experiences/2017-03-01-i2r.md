Publication: [A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to Detect Responses to Affective Audiovisual Stimuli from EEG](http://ircset.org/anand/2017papers/IRC-SET_2017_paper_S6-2.pdf), IRC-SET 2017

Developed a BCI to control a LEGO robot wheelchair using electroencephalogram (EEG) and motor imagery. Architected a BCI to detect responses to affective audiovisual stimuli from EEG to aid patients suffering from alexithymia. Implemented front-end C# GUI program to run experiments and collect EEG for analysis from 29 participants. Analyzed experiment data using MATLAB to perform k-fold cross validation and calculate statistical significance of results.
